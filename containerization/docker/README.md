# **Docker Common Workflow & Commands**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ What is Docker?**
**Docker** is a platform that enables developers to easily build, ship, and run applications inside lightweight containers. Containers package an application and its dependencies together, ensuring that the application runs consistently across different environments.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Setting Up Docker Environment**
Before using Docker, ensure that Docker is installed and running. Here's how to check and manage Docker services on your machine:

```bash
# Check Docker version
docker --version

# Start Docker service (if not running)
sudo systemctl start docker

# Check Docker status
sudo systemctl status docker
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Working with Docker Images**

**What are Docker Images?**  
Docker images are the templates used to create Docker containers. They contain everything needed to run a containerized application, including the application code, system tools, libraries, and dependencies.

**Commands:**

```bash
# Pull an image from Docker Hub
docker pull <image_name>

# List all available images
docker images

# Build an image from a Dockerfile
docker build -t <image_name> <path_to_dockerfile>

# Remove an image
docker rmi <image_name>

# Tag an image
docker tag <source_image> <target_image>
```

**Example:**
```bash
# Pull the official Nginx image from Docker Hub
docker pull nginx

# List images
docker images

# Build a custom image from a Dockerfile in the current directory
docker build -t my_custom_image .

# Remove a specific image
docker rmi my_custom_image
```

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Working with Docker Containers**

**What are Docker Containers?**  
Containers are instances of Docker images. They run applications in an isolated environment, with their own filesystem, processes, and network. Containers provide a lightweight and consistent environment for your application to run.

**Commands:**

```bash
# Run a new container in detached mode (-d)
docker run -d --name <container_name> <image_name>

# List running containers
docker ps

# List all containers (including stopped ones)
docker ps -a

# Stop a running container
docker stop <container_name>

# Start a stopped container
docker start <container_name>

# Remove a container
docker rm <container_name>

# Attach to a running container‚Äôs terminal
docker exec -it <container_name> bash

# View logs of a container
docker logs <container_name>
```

**Example:**
```bash
# Run an Nginx container in detached mode
docker run -d --name my_nginx nginx

# List all running containers
docker ps

# Attach to a running container
docker exec -it my_nginx bash
```

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Working with Docker Networks**

**What are Docker Networks?**  
Docker networks allow containers to communicate with each other and external systems. There are different types of networks available, and you can create custom networks based on your needs.

**Commands:**

```bash
# List all networks
docker network ls

# Create a custom bridge network
docker network create <network_name>

# Run a container on a specific network
docker run -d --name <container_name> --network <network_name> <image_name>

# Inspect a network‚Äôs configuration
docker network inspect <network_name>

# Connect a container to a network
docker network connect <network_name> <container_name>

# Disconnect a container from a network
docker network disconnect <network_name> <container_name>
```

**Example:**
```bash
# Create a custom network named "my_network"
docker network create my_network

# Run a container on the custom network
docker run -d --name my_nginx --network my_network nginx

# Inspect network details
docker network inspect my_network
```

---

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Working with Docker Volumes**

**What are Docker Volumes?**  
Docker volumes are used to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers. They are stored outside of containers, allowing data to persist even if the container is removed. Volumes are ideal for managing database data or application logs.

**Commands:**

```bash
# Create a volume
docker volume create <volume_name>

# List all volumes
docker volume ls

# Inspect a specific volume
docker volume inspect <volume_name>

# Remove a volume
docker volume rm <volume_name>

# Run a container with a volume attached
docker run -d -v <volume_name>:<container_path> <image_name>
```

**Example:**
```bash
# Create a volume named "my_volume"
docker volume create my_volume

# Run a container with the volume attached
docker run -d -v my_volume:/data nginx

# List volumes
docker volume ls
```

---

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Docker Compose (for Multi-Container Applications)**

**What is Docker Compose?**  
Docker Compose is a tool used to define and manage multi-container applications. Using a YAML file (`docker-compose.yml`), you can define the services that your app needs (like databases, web servers, etc.) and start them together with a single command.

**Commands:**

```bash
# Start up services defined in a docker-compose.yml file
docker-compose up

# Start services in detached mode
docker-compose up -d

# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# View logs of services
docker-compose logs

# Build or rebuild services
docker-compose build
```

**Example:**
```bash
# Create a docker-compose.yml file for multi-container setup (e.g., nginx + db)
docker-compose up -d

# Stop the services
docker-compose down
```

---

### **8Ô∏è‚É£ Docker System Commands**

**What are Docker System Commands?**  
These commands help manage Docker's overall system, including cleaning up unused resources and monitoring disk usage.

**Commands:**

```bash
# Clean up unused containers, images, volumes, and networks
docker system prune

# Check Docker system-wide usage stats
docker system df

# Remove all stopped containers, unused networks, images, and volumes
docker system prune -a
```

**Example:**
```bash
# Prune unused Docker objects
docker system prune

# View disk usage stats for Docker
docker system df
```

---

### **9Ô∏è‚É£ Docker Inspect**

**What is it?**  
`docker inspect` is a command that provides detailed information about Docker containers, images, volumes, and networks. This is useful when troubleshooting or understanding the configuration of a Docker resource.

**Commands:**

```bash
# Inspect a container‚Äôs details
docker inspect <container_name_or_id>

# Inspect an image‚Äôs details
docker inspect <image_name_or_id>

# Inspect network details
docker network inspect <network_name>

# Inspect volume details
docker volume inspect <volume_name>
```

**Example:**
```bash
# Inspect container details
docker inspect my_nginx

# Inspect image details
docker inspect nginx

# Inspect volume details
docker volume inspect my_volume
```
